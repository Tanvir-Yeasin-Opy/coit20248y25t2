# Week 3 - Agile Methodologies

## 1. What are Agile Methodologies?
Agile methodologies are a set of project management approaches that emphasize flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development. They break down projects into smaller, manageable cycles called "sprints," allowing for continuous feedback, adaptation to change, 
and faster delivery of working software or products. Instead of rigid, linear plans, agile prioritizes adaptability, customer collaboration, and continuous improvement.

## 2. What is at the heart of the systems development process? How does it fit within the larger SDLC framework?

At the heart of systems development is **requirements gathering and analysis**, ensuring the system meets stakeholder needs. Within the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**, it guides all other stagesâ€”from design and implementation to testing and maintenance.

## 3. Explain eXtreme Programming. When do you think it can be used? Provide some real-world situations.

**eXtreme Programming (XP)** is an Agile method focusing on technical excellence and frequent releases. Key practices include pair programming, continuous integration, and test-driven development.

**Use Case Example:** Ideal for dynamic, fast-changing environments like a startup developing a mobile app where requirements evolve rapidly based on user feedback.

## 4. What is Agile Usage-Centered Design? How is it used for requirements determination?

Agile Usage-Centered Design focuses on users' needs and interactions with the system. It uses **personas, scenarios, and essential use cases** to define requirements based on actual usage patterns, promoting clarity and user-focused functionality.

## 5. Explain how testing differs in Agile Methodologies and in traditional approaches.

In Agile, **testing is continuous and integrated** from the beginning (e.g., through test-driven development and automated testing). In traditional models (like Waterfall), testing is a separate phase near the end, often delaying bug detection and resolution.

## 6. How are design specifications handled in Agile Methodologies?
Design specifications in Agile are **lightweight, just-in-time, and evolving**. They are not rigid documents but emerge and adapt as the system is developed and feedback is received.

## 7. What is simple design? What is refactoring?

* **Simple Design:** Focuses on building the minimal viable functionality needed at the moment, avoiding overengineering.
* **Refactoring:** Continuously improving code structure without changing its behavior to enhance readability, maintainability, and flexibility.

## 8. What have we learned about Agile development methods in practice?

In practice, Agile improves **customer satisfaction, adaptability, and delivery speed**. However, it requires disciplined teams, close collaboration, and may be challenging in large, highly regulated environments.

## **9. When should you use an Agile method, and when should you use an engineering-based method for developing a system?**

* Use **Agile** for projects with **unclear or evolving requirements**, rapid delivery needs, and high user involvement.
* Use **engineering-based (Waterfall)** for **predictable, well-defined** projects like safety-critical systems (e.g., medical or aerospace software) where compliance is crucial.

## 10. How widespread are the Agile Methodologies in the information technology industry?

Agile is **highly widespread**. Surveys like the *State of Agile Report* show over **90% of organizations** using Agile practices, with Scrum being the most popular. Agile is prevalent in software, but also increasingly adopted in finance, marketing, and HR.
